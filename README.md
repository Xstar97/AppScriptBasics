samples and basic scripts to do stuff on www.script.google.com


### YOUTUBE
Youtube sucks but we can make it better since they removed the dislike counter!

if youre a creator and want to show your viewers the count then try this awesome script out.

checkout one of my (latest streams)(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQO1cJDwqF8&t=3717s) thats gets triggered every 5 mins.

as long as you own the video and channel, you can the likes and dislikes counter on any video.

open a tab and copy the contents of the script into a new project on www.script.google.com

[youtubeLikes.gs](https://github.com/Xstar97/AppScriptBasics/blob/main/youtube/YouTubeLikes.gs)

do a quick read and some minor edits if you need to before executing it...
most of the variables are situated at the top.
once done and excuted, refresh page and viola the title changed and has added this.(the view counter had been removed)

![likes counter](https://github.com/Xstar97/AppScriptBasics/blob/a112ed56ebeb9d64803e55af9348aff722797fcb/youtube/likes%20and%20dislikes.png?raw=true)
